# Documented here are the results for solving: 
# - "How to plot a line geom when we only have a frequency count of (x) ?" - 
# Answer:it was done by creating a "table" object from a vector of dates,
# and plotting a 'y=' as the frequency count of unique dates in the table.  

# Note: answering this question is part of a larger project, seems like 
# oversharing is better than under. SEE LINES 65:92 for solution.
